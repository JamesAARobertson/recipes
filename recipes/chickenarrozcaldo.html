    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
      <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 lemon, sliced (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step 1: Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion,
        garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add
        chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover,
        and cook another 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring
        mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally
        to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with
        lemon slices and additional fish sauce, if desired.
      </li>
